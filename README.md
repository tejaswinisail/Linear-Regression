# Linear-regression
Simple Linear regression is a statistical method used to predict the correlation or relationship between two variables.  

In this task, I have implemented the concept of LINEAR REGRESSION to find how the score of a student in exam changes with number of hours they study. 
Simple linear regression is a straight line with positive/negative/zero slope.

Y = m(X) + c where, Y is dependent variable  X is independent variable m is slope or coefficient c is intercept or constant.
